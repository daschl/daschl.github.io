      <description>Motivation Since I work as part of the engineering team at Couchbase, I need to run my code against a variety of server deployments. We run a multitude of operating systems and software versions, and so do our customers. In order to fix bugs reliably and build new features, it is critical to get a cluster up and running that resembles these deployments as good as possible. I know that I can run all of these combinations on EC2, but the cost for this would be very high and most of the time its overkill.</description>
