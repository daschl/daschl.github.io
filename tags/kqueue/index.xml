      <description>As a more or less POSIX compatible system I would&amp;rsquo;ve expected timer_create and friends to be available on OS X, but it turns out those functions are not available (at least I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find them after hours of research).
Looking into alternatives (spoiler: there are not many I think if you want to work from C/Rust) I settled on Kqueue. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have all the features that the timer_ functions provide, but for what I need it seems to be good enough.</description>
