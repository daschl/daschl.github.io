      <description>TL:DR; When acquiring Channels in Netty, always use a ChannelFutureListener and never awaitUninterruptibly(). Curious why? Read on.
In the Java SDK for Couchbase, we use Netty to establish and maintain a streaming connection to one of the cluster nodes in order to get notified when topology changes happen. This streaming connection needs to be established during the bootstrap process of the client and we need to block until the connection is established (actually we don&amp;rsquo;t need to, but the current implementation works that way).</description>
