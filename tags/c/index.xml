      <description>The following list is a convenient way to get access to lots of resources, blog posts and material that have been shared throughout the past months. I tried to separate them by area, but of course lots of them overlap to some extent.
They are sorted by date (so you&amp;rsquo;ll find the most recent ones on top) and include the author where possible. Be aware that some of the older articles may already be outdated or not 100% accurate.</description>
