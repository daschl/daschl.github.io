      <description>The last weeks have been pretty exciting for me. I joined Couchbase as a Developer Advocate mostly working on the Java and PHP SDKs as well as helping out developers who are getting started with our product or have questions during their development process.
The 2.0 release is currently in beta and can be downloaded here, you may also want to look into the decent documentation put together by our docs team.</description>
