      <description>The following list is a convenient way to get access to lots of resources, blog posts and material that have been shared throughout the past months. I tried to separate them by area, but of course lots of them overlap to some extent.
They are sorted by date (so you&amp;rsquo;ll find the most recent ones on top) and include the author where possible. Be aware that some of the older articles may already be outdated or not 100% accurate.</description>

      <title>A Journey on Avoiding Nulls in PHP</title>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/A-Journey-on-Avoiding-Nulls-in-PHP/</guid>
      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it: nulls are a hassle and lead to exceptions and inconsistent application state. Tony Hoare, the inventor of QuickSort, even calls it his billion dollar mistake.
While every developer has kind of accepted their existence, they are suddenly there when we&amp;rsquo;d desperately need them to not show up. How often did you writeif($obj === null) in your PHP code? Can&amp;rsquo;t there be a better, more elegant and fault-tolerant solution to the problem?</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Cache Transcoders in PHP</title>
      <link>https://nitschinger.at/Benchmarking-Cache-Transcoders-in-PHP/</link>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/Benchmarking-Cache-Transcoders-in-PHP/</guid>
      <description>Motivation Storing PHP objects (or simpler data types like arrays) in caches always requires some kind of transformation. You need a way of encoding/decoding data so that it can be stored and loaded properly. In most languages, this process is known as object serialization. PHP provides a mechanism for this out of the box, but in this article we&amp;rsquo;ll also look at igbinary as a drop-in replacement for the default serializer.</description>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/Caching-Doctrine-Entities-with-Couchbase/</guid>
      <description>Motivation As part of our ongoing efforts to make Couchbase more integrated with frameworks and libraries, we added caching support for the Doctrine ORM. Recently, the pull request has been merged into the master branch and is scheduled to be published along with the 2.4 release.
Caching can either be used standalone (through the API provided by doctrine/common) or integrated with the ORM functionality. We&amp;rsquo;ll look at both variants through simple examples, a good documentation can also be found here.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a decent PHP user group here in Vienna for some time. Sadly, I haven&amp;rsquo;t found even a bad one. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to change this: meet viennaphp.org.
My goal is to create a friendly, welcoming and informative user group that allows beginners and experts alike to share their experiences, opinions and knowledge. I have always met great people when I worked with the open-source community and I think lots of people around here would benefit from it too.</description>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/How-to-store-PHP-sessions-in-Couchbase/</guid>
      <description>My last post about storing sessions in Couchbase was more of a general overview on what&amp;rsquo;s possible. This post builds on the foundations and principles discussed and shows you various ways to store PHP sessions in Couchbase. We start out simple by using the built-in session ini -directives, then head over to the brand new SessionHandlerInterface introduced in PHP 5.4 and finally implement it completely on our own. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how both the complexity and flexibility increase during each of our approaches.</description>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/Using-Couchbase-as-a-flexible-session-store/</guid>
      <description>This post shows you how you can use the Couchbase 2.0 server as a flexible session store. What do I mean by flexible? Well, the combination of a highly scalable key-value store and the possibility to query your data through views allows you to gain unique insight inside your data in near realtime.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some obstacles that we as application developers face and then see how we may solve them through Couchbase and its functionality.</description>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/Handling-JSON-like-a-boss-in-PHP/</guid>
      <description>There are already lots of tutorials out there on handling JSON with PHP, but most of them don&amp;rsquo;t go much deeper than throwing an array against json_encode and hoping for the best. This article aims to be a solid introduction into JSON and how to handle it correctly in combination with PHP. Also, readers who don&amp;rsquo;t use PHP as their programming language can benefit from the first part that acts as a general overview on JSON.</description>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/A-primer-on-PHP-exceptions/</guid>
      <description>Preface Exceptions are and should be an integral part of any general purpose programming language. PHP introduced them long ago (with the release of PHP 5 or 5.1), but it still seems that many of the concepts are not fully understood or ignored by the community. This post aims to be a solid introduction to exception architecture, handling and testing. At the end of the post you should be able to know when to raise an exception and how it should look like.</description>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/Writing-a-simple-lexer-in-PHP/</guid>
      <description>Introduction A lot of developers avoid writing parsers because they think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty hard to do so. Writing an efficient parser for a general purpose language (like PHP, Ruby, Java,&amp;hellip;) is hard, but fortunately, most of the time we don&amp;rsquo;t need that much complexity. Typically we just want to parse input coming from config files or from a specific problem domain (expressed through DSLs). DSLs (Domain Specific Languages) are pretty cool, because they allow you to express logic and flow in a very specific and convenient way for a limited set of tasks.</description>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/Getting-Started-with-Couchbase-and-PHP/</guid>
      <description>Couchbase is a simple, fast and elastic document-oriented database. It is the product of a merge between the companies behind Memcached (Membase) and CouchDB. The current version is 1.8 and the 2.0 version is already in a developer preview release. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard much about Couchbase yet, start at the Couchbase Webinar Series, which will get you up to speed. The full manual is available here.
As there were a lot of merges, renamings and releases, it was pretty hard to follow up with the current/best database version and SDK to use for your project.</description>

      <description>Introduction The model relationship support in Lithium is one of the hottest topics on IRC lately, so I thought it would be a good idea to blog about it.
Currently, Lithium supports 1:1 and 1:n relationships for relational databases. There is no m:n support out of the box (like CakePHP&amp;rsquo;s $hasAndBelongsToMany). This also means that MongoDB relationships are not implemented for now. If you look at the Roadmap, you can see that this is on the &amp;ldquo;pre 1.</description>

      <description>The li3_fixtures plugin was my first Lithium plugin ever, and while it works okay, I feel there is a lot I can do to make it better and more flexible. In this post I want to share my ideas for a new fixture plugin and also want to gather feedback from the community to make it even more awesome.
As far as I can see, there are three big use cases for fixtures:</description>

      <description>About Composer Composer is a command-line tool that helps you manage your application dependencies. It automatically fetches packages, resolves dependencies and is easy to configure. The really good thing about Composer is that it isn&amp;rsquo;t bound to a specific framework and can be used with every kind of repository. Composer is similar to package managers like npm, so you may feel at home quickly.
The default repository of Composer is Packagist.</description>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/Session-Encryption-with-Lithium/</guid>
      <description>The Basics If you check out the master branch, you can use the new Encrypt strategy to encrypt your session data automatically. This means that you can read and write session data in cleartext and they will be encrypted on the fly before getting stored (in a cookie, for example). You can read my post about &amp;ldquo;baking cookies like a chef&amp;rdquo; for PHPAdvent 2011 here. The article covers both HMAC signatures and encryption, and is a good place to start.</description>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/Quick-Tip-Lithium-Redirect/</guid>
      <description>While migrating lithium_bin as part of research over to MongoDB (from CouchDB), I found the following snippet in the routes.php file:
Router::connect(&#39;/&#39;, array(), function($request) { $location = array(&#39;controller&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;pastes&#39;, &#39;action&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;add&#39;); return new Response(compact(&#39;location&#39;)); });  This means that when the user enters the application via the root url (/), he instantly gets redirected to /pastes/add (or a different URL if you have custom routes configured).
This may seem ok at first, but there&amp;rsquo;s a problem.</description>

      <title>Using Environments in Lithium</title>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/Using-Environments-in-Lithium/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Environments help you to manage multiple configurations for your application. Maybe you have a different database for testing than for production or you use file caching in development but APC in production. If your framework does not support this (or a similar) concept, it can be a pain to code this overhead for yourself. Therefore, Lithium frees you from this by providing a Environment class (in the \lithium\core namespace) which handles everything for you automatically.</description>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/Testing-the-Lithium-core-for-fun-and-profit/</guid>
      <description>In modern web frameworks, testing is one of the most important pillars that ensure a clean, stable and extendable codebase. Testing support in Lithium was built in from the beginning and therefore it already features a great code coverage. The Lithium project aims to work out of the box on many platforms, including Microsoft Windows and its IIS, which was often neglected in the past.
The main purpose of this post is to show you how core tests work and were the core team needs help to improve things further.</description>

      <description>CSRF (Cross-Site-Request-Forgery) attacks work by sending arbitary (form) requests from a victim. Normally, the receiving site (in our case the Controller who processes the form data) doesn&amp;rsquo;t know where the data comes from. The CSRF protection in Lithium aims to solve this problem in an elegant and secure way. You can read more about those attacks here. Note that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to clone the latest master branch of Lithium if you want to try it out now.</description>

      <description>Finders assist you with often-used database queries so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to write them over and over again. Out of the box, Lithium provides you with a bunch of them: all, first, count list and &amp;ldquo;magic finders like&amp;rdquo; findById or findFirstById. How these are constructed in the core is not relevant for now, but Lithium provides you with a mechanism to write your own finders easily.
To understand how we can implement our own finder, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the built-in first one.</description>

      <description>If you need to cache full Response objects in Lithium (which means that your controllers don&amp;rsquo;t even get called when there&amp;rsquo;s a cache hit), you can place this in your app/config/bootstrap/cache.php file (note that this is certainly not &amp;ldquo;production ready&amp;rdquo;, but it should give you a starting point):
/** * Cache full Responses */ Dispatcher::applyFilter(&#39;run&#39;, function($self, $params, $chain) { $key = md5(LITHIUM_APP_PATH) . &#39;.app.cache.&#39;.md5($params[&#39;request&#39;]-&amp;gt;url); if($cache = Cache::read(&#39;default&#39;, $key)) { return $cache; } $result = $chain-&amp;gt;next($self, $params, $chain); Cache::write(&#39;default&#39;, $key, $result, &#39;+1 day&#39;); return $result; });  It filters the Dispatcher and first checks if the Response object is already stored in the cache.</description>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/Understanding-the-Lithium-Router-Part-2/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Routes play an essential role in your request/response-cycle and therefore should also be tested like any other component that you develop. As the Lithium routing infrastructure also consists of classes and methods, we can run unit and integration tests against them.
If we follow the testing conventions, we need to differentiate two distinct methods of testing. The first one (the so called &amp;ldquo;Unit Test&amp;rdquo;), is used to test your routes one by one, isolated from your application and ideally all dependencies are mocked away.</description>

      <guid>https://nitschinger.at/Understanding-the-Lithium-Router-Part-1/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The router is an integral part of the framework and has two main purposes. The first one is to match a URL against a set of previously connected routes, the second one is to generate a URL from a set of arguments (reverse routing). The router itself is very flexible as we&amp;rsquo;ll see later on, but getting started is pretty easy. Lithium comes with a set of sensible default routes that help you to get on track immediately.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Inflector is one of many utility classes that ship with Lithium out of the box. Those classes are designed to assist you with common tasks that need to be done.
One of those tasks may be to pluralize, singularize, camel-case or humanize strings, database keys or other dynamic content. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how the class itself is described:

      <description>When you write tests for your classes (and you should), you may run into the problem that you create large arrays of test data in your code. Consider the following example:
$expected = array( &#39;post1&#39; =&amp;gt; array( &#39;title&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;My First Post&#39;, &#39;content&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;First Content...&#39; ), &#39;post2&#39; =&amp;gt; array( &#39;title&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;My Second Post&#39;, &#39;content&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;Also some foobar text&#39; ), &#39;post3&#39; =&amp;gt; array( &#39;title&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;My Third Post&#39;, &#39;content&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;I like to write some foobar foo too&#39; ) ); $this-&amp;gt;assertEqual($expected[0], Post::first()); /* more tests down here */  This creates a nested array of test data where each inner array mocks a post stored in the database.</description>

      <description>Lithium comes with two helpers out of the box. The Form-Helper and the Html-Helper. Both are great and help you to make your View-Code more flexible, maintainable and easier to read.
But what do you do when you need a functionality that they don&amp;rsquo;t provide? Right, you write your own. Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine you want to tell your blog-readers how many posts you have stored in your database. In our first iteration our code might look like this:</description>

      <description>Adding an RSS-Feed to your blog with li3 is really straightforward, because all the infrastructure you need is already at your fingertips. I assume that you already have some posts stored in your database, you serve them to your users via /posts and the new RSS-File should be accessible via /posts.rss.
First, we need to tell Lithium that we want to add another Media-Type to our application. Add the following to your app/config/bootstrap/media.</description>

      <title>Lithium Routes And MongoDB</title>

      <description>Lithium comes with a powerful and flexible routing system. However, in its default configuration, you may encounter some problems with MongoDB-ObjectIDs and reverse routing. ObjectIDs are usually the &amp;ldquo;primary keys&amp;rdquo; of your Document in MongoDB, are 12 bytes long and consist of numbers and characters from &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;f&amp;rsquo;. A typical ObjectID would look similar to 4ce2d9f99436485e05000000.
If you take a closer look at the default routes that ship with Lithium, you&amp;rsquo;ll maybe notice that the :id part only matches numbers (and not characters).</description>
