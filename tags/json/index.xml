      <description>Motivation Storing PHP objects (or simpler data types like arrays) in caches always requires some kind of transformation. You need a way of encoding/decoding data so that it can be stored and loaded properly. In most languages, this process is known as object serialization. PHP provides a mechanism for this out of the box, but in this article we&amp;rsquo;ll also look at igbinary as a drop-in replacement for the default serializer.</description>

      <description>There are already lots of tutorials out there on handling JSON with PHP, but most of them don&amp;rsquo;t go much deeper than throwing an array against json_encode and hoping for the best. This article aims to be a solid introduction into JSON and how to handle it correctly in combination with PHP. Also, readers who don&amp;rsquo;t use PHP as their programming language can benefit from the first part that acts as a general overview on JSON.</description>
