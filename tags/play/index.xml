      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been mostly blogging about PHP and Lithium, but recently I&amp;rsquo;ve also been looking into a very promising framework on the JVM - the play! framework. The current version (2.0) brings lots of enhancements and features and is (at least to me) the first framework that really boosts developer productivity on the JVM (and that I would work with in my free time).
In this project, we&amp;rsquo;ll develop a chat application (called couchplay) that allows people to login with a username and then talk to others in real-time.</description>
